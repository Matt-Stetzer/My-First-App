While being bedridden on antibiotics for 4 months afterwards, I had a lot of time to think about what i wanted in life now that I'd had a close scrape with death. I realized that the most important things in my life are family and the pursuit of greatness in the form of helping inspire people to achieve their best in all aspects of life."
